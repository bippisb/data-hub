The MGNREGA program is a flagship social welfare program of the Indian government that guarantees 100 days of employment to every rural household in the country, with a special focus on the poorest and most marginalized communities. The dataset includes information on the number of households and individuals who have benefited from the program, the amount of funds disbursed, and the types of work undertaken by program beneficiaries. The dataset is organized according to various dimensions, such as state, district, and financial year, making it easy for users to filter and analyze the data according to their specific needs. The dataset is relevant to a wide range of stakeholders, including government officials, social scientists, policy think tanks, media houses, and newsrooms. The data is collected and maintained by the Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India, and is available for download on the MGNREGA website. The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and journalists interested in issues related to rural employment, poverty reduction, social inclusion, and sustainable development in

    "description": ": The dataset provides comprehensive financial and physical progress information for all road projects that are being implemented under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMSGY) in India. PMSGY is a government-led initiative aimed at connecting all unconnected habitations in rural areas with all-weather roads, which is critical to the socio-economic development of rural India. The dataset includes information such as the total cost of the project, the amount of funds allocated, the expenditure incurred so far, the length of the road constructed, the percentage of the road completed, and the quality of the construction work. This information can be used to monitor the progress of each project and to identify any areas where improvements are needed. \r\n\r\n| Variable Name                         | Variable Description                                            | Variable Type | Unit Of Measurement | Constant Unit / Changing Unit |\r\n|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------|------------------------------|\r\n| state_name                           | State                                                          | TEXT         |                     | True                         |\r\n| state_code                           | State Code                                                     | TEXT         |                     | True                         |\r\n| district_name                        | District                                                       | TEXT         |                     | True                         |\r\n| district_code                        | District Code                                                  | TEXT         |                     | True                         |\r\n| block_name                           | Block                                                          | TEXT         |                     | True                         |\r\n| block_code                           | Block Code                                                     | TEXT         |                     | True                         |\r\n| habitation_name                      | Habitation Name                                                | TEXT         |                     | True                         |\r\n| road_name                            | Road Name                                                      | TEXT         |                     | True                         |\r\n| packages                             | Packages from which the funds were sanctioned                  | TEXT         |                     | True                         |\r\n| upgrade_or_new                       | Whether the project is an upgrade of an existing road or a new road?

    "description": "This dataset provides an extensive and nuanced profile of Self-Help Groups (SHGs) across diverse geographic and socio-economic contexts. It includes detailed information on the SHG's location, specifying the state, district, block, Gram Panchayat, and village, alongside a unique SHG identifier and its name. Key administrative details such as the date of formation, type of SHG, promoting entity, and banking informationâ€”including the bank name, branch, and account opening dateâ€”are also recorded. The dataset meticulously documents membership demographics, including total membership counts, gender distribution, and classifications by social categories such as Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe, Other Backward Classes, and Other Social Categories. Additionally, it captures data on members with disabilities, both self-disabled and those with disabled family members, and provides insights into religious affiliations (Hindu, Christian, Muslim, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi) and economic status, distinguishing between Above Poverty Line (APL), Below Poverty Line (BPL), and Poorest of the Poor under the PIP category.\r\n\r\n\r\n| Variable Name

    "description": "The \"VAHAN Vehicle Registrations\" dataset provides comprehensive data on vehicle registrations across India, offering insights into various aspects such as vehicle norms, manufacturers, fuel types, categories, and classes. This dataset includes key variables like the date of registration, state names and codes, Regional Transport Office (RTO) names and codes, vehicle manufacturers, fuel types (e.g., petrol, diesel, electric), vehicle categories (e.g., two-wheeler, four-wheeler), and vehicle classes. Additionally, it categorizes data by specific norms, vehicle types, and other criteria, detailing the number of registrations for each category. This resource is invaluable for policymakers, transportation authorities, analysts, and the automotive industry, enabling them to monitor and understand trends in vehicle registrations, compliance with regulations, and the environmental impact of fuel usage across different regions and RTOs in India. \r\n\r\n| Variable Name    | Variable Description | Variable Type |\r\n|------------------|----------------------|---------------|\r\n| date             | Date                 | DATE          |\r\n| state_name       | State Name           | TEXT          |\r\n| state_code       | State Code           | TEXT          |\r\n| office_name      | RTO Name             | TEXT          |\r\n| office_code      | RTO Code             | TEXT          |\r\n| type             | Fuel                 | TEXT          |\r\n| category         | Category             | TEXT          |\r\n| registrations    | Registrations        | NUMERIC       |\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE: Vehicle registration data for Telangana is not available in the VAHAN database, as the state does not subscribe to VAHAN.
